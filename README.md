## Introduction

The **Simple Quiz App** is a web-based application that allows users to take multiple-choice quizzes. The user can select answers, navigate through questions, and get feedback on their responses. At the end of the quiz, the user receives a score indicating their performance.

## Features

- **Interactive Quiz**: Users can select answers, navigate between questions, and receive immediate feedback.
- **Multiple-Choice Questions**: Each question offers multiple answers, and only one is correct.
- **Score Tracking**: The app keeps track of the user's score and displays it at the end of the quiz.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is designed to work on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Dynamic UI**: Questions and answers are dynamically created using JavaScript, allowing for easy updates or changes to the quiz content.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the web page.
- **CSS**: Styling for the layout and appearance.
- **JavaScript**: Logic for the quiz functionality, including generating questions, tracking scores, and handling user interactions.
